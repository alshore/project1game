# project1game
For this project I made a blackjack game. The cards are dealt using a card function and the random module.
I've included if/elif/else statements, loops, error catching, objects and user interaction.
I used the book, Introducing Python, as a refresher for the error catching syntax (103-105).
I used stack overflow to remind me how to read and write to a file: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277503/how-to-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-a-list-with-python
